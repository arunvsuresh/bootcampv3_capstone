**Abstract Title:** Integrated Analysis of Software Development Trends Using GitHub and Stack Overflow Data

**Abstract:**
I'm aiming to provide comprehensive insights into software development trends by analyzing real-time data from GitHub and Stack Overflow. Utilizing an ETL pipeline that harnesses Flink and Spark, I will correlate development activities on GitHub with discussions and problem-solving patterns on Stack Overflow. This approach offers a multifaceted view of the software development landscape, revealing connections between active development projects and the developer community's challenges and interests.

**Data Sources:**
- **GitHub API:** Provides real-time repository activities and developer interactions.
- **Stack Overflow (Stack Exchange API):** Offers real-time developer discussions, questions, and answers.

**Use Cases:**
- Track technology trends and development challenges.
- Guide project strategies and resources based on developer needs and interests.

**Technologies and Tools:**
- Real-time data streaming processing and management with Flink.
- Historical data analysis with Apache Spark.
- Data visualization tools (Looker) for insightful presentation of findings.

**Business Impact:**
The integration of GitHub and Stack Overflow data will enable technology companies and open-source communities to align their strategies with current trends, address prevalent issues in software development, and enhance developer engagement.
